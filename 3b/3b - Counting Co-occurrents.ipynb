      "Now it is time to put your functions to the test with your own texts.  If you did not bring your own texts to the summer school with you, use the texts in the `Data` folder for lesson 1b.  Below, write a script that will go to the folder on your computer where your text files are, return a list of the names of all the .txt files in that folder (_Hint:_ Check out <a href='https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.listdir'>os.listdir()</a> function to help with this), and then runs each text through each of the functions you wrote above.  Finally, convert both your dictionaries into Pandas objects (you decide which `type` is the best for each dictionary) and save them as `.pickle` files using the `df.to_pickle()` method.<br>\n",
      "As background, `pickle` serializes your Python objects, which basically means that it saves your Python objects as Python objects, e.g., it will save your dictionaries as Python dictionary objects.  This is typically both more efficient in terms of disk storage space and in processing time when saving and reloading the objects from and back into Python.<br><br>\n",
      "_Hint:_ You might also want to check out the <a href='http://tkinter.unpythonic.net/wiki/tkFileDialog'>tkinter.filedialog</a> functions.  They open an open or save file dialog interface so that you can choose the files that you want to work with on-the-fly.  They are great tools to ease file interaction and to generalize the code you write for different purposes and different operating systems.<br><br>\n",
      "_Hint #2:_ If you are running out of memory when producing your Pandas objects or pickling them, try `del` objects that you don't need any more.  For instance, once you have run the `make_count_dict` and `make_cooc_dict` functions, you don't need `types` anymore.  So type: `del types`.  Do the same with your dictionaries once you have converted them to Pandas objects and your Pandas objects once you have pickled them."
