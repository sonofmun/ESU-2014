      "`igraphs` is sort of like the Gephi for Python.  It allows you to construct very nice network graphs but gives you much more control over the whole process than you get with Gephi.  In this lesson, we will dive quickly into `igraphs` with a focus on how to construct semantic network visualizations.  We will also learn how to export our graph data in a form that can be imported into a program like Gephi and, best of all, one strategy for dealing with huge network graphs that will avoid the 'hairball' usually associated with these graphs.<br>\n",
