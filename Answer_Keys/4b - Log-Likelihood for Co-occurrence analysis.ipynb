The equation means that the frequency of $t$ is the sum for every $c$ (co-occurrent) of the number of times that $t$ (target word) and $c$ co-occur divided by the total size of the co-occurrence window. In our `cooc_dict` in lesson 3b we calculated the number of times that every $t$ co-occurred with every $c$.  And we know the total window size.
