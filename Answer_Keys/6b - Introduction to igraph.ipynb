      "`igraphs` is sort of like the Gephi for Python.  It allows you to construct very nice network graphs but gives you much more control over the whole process than you get with Gephi.  In this lesson, we will dive quickly into `igraphs` with a focus on how to construct semantic network visualizations.  We will also learn how to export our graph data in a form that can be imported into a program like Gephi and, best of all, one strategy for dealing with huge network graphs that will avoid the 'hairball' usually associated with these graphs.<br>\n",

Their purpose is to position the nodes of a graph in two-dimensional or three-dimensional space so that all the edges are of more or less equal length and there are as few crossing edges as possible, by assigning forces among the set of edges and the set of nodes, based on their relative positions, and then using these forces either to simulate the motion of the edges and nodes or to minimize their energy.
